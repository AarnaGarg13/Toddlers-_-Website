The wolf ran to Grannys house and ate Granny up. He got into Grannys bed. A little later, Little Red Riding Hood reached the house. She looked at the wolf. Granny, what big eyes you have. All the better to see you with, said the wolf. Granny, what big ears you have. All the better to hear you with, said the wolf. Granny, what a big nose you have. All the better to smell you with, said the wolf. Granny, what big teeth you have. All the better to eat you with, shouted the wolf. A woodcutter was in the wood. He heard a loud scream and ran to the house. The woodcutter hit the wolf over the head. The wolf opened his mouth wide and shouted and Granny jumped out. The wolf ran away and Little Red Riding Hood never saw the wolf again.')">
